# Getting started

October is a small desktop utility for syncing Kobo highlights to [Readwise](https://readwise.io).

It has a tight scope, just aiming to do this one thing and do it well.

There are plenty of other tools we can leverage such as [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for managing books on your eReader.

October's primary aim is to make it as simple as two clicks (once set up) to sync your highlights with Readwise.

All releases are distributed via [Github Releases](https://github.com/marcus-crane/october/releases) although the actual installation procedures differ for each platform.
