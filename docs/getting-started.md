# Getting started

October is a small desktop utility for syncing Kobo highlights to [Readwise](https://readwise.io).

It has a tight scope, just aiming to do this one thing and do it well.

There are plenty of other tools we can leverage such as [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for managing books on your eReader.

October's primary aim is to make it as simple as two clicks (once set up) to sync your highlights with Readwise.

## Installation

All releases are distributed via [Github Releases](https://github.com/marcus-crane/october/releases) although the actual installation procedures differ for each platform.
