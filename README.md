# October
> Easily submit your Kobo highlights to Readwise (and eventually more)

## What is October?

A small [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) application for syncing your highlights with [Readwise](https://readwise.io) across Windows, macOS and Linux.

Kobo eReaders are somewhat notorious for not being user friendly to extract highlights off of. Personally I only send mine to Readwise anyway so this tool does just that in as little as two clicks.

You can learn more by browsing the official [documentation website](https://october.utf9k.net) or [grab the latest release](https://github.com/marcus-crane/october/releases) to start using it.
